## Programming Assignment

### Chapter 2:

#### hours\_in\_year.rb

- Requirements
  - When run, it must print out the number of hours in a year.
- Advice
  - This should be an integer.
  - Up to you how you account for leap years! If you're not familiar with the rules, give it a quick Google!

#### minutes\_in\_decade.rb

- Requirements
  - When run, it must print out the number of minutes in a decade.
- Advice
  - For this one, make sure to account for the leap years!

#### age\_in\_seconds.rb

- Requirements
  - In order to have a standardized answer we can check against, please instead calculate Berkeley's age in seconds, and do it from the time this will be due (Friday the 28th).
  - For fun, you can check your as well, but we'll be grading based on the Berkeley one.
- Advice
  - Remember to account for leap years, and for months/days since the birthday last passed!
  - You can check out this <a href="https://www.free-online-calculator-use.com/leap-year-calculator.html">site</a> for the number of leap years you need to account for.

#### author\_age.rb

- Requirements
  - When run, it must print out the author's age in years
- Advice
  - For this one, make sure to remember that integer division rounds down in Ruby, so to get a more accurate number add a decimal so you use float division instead
  - Also leap years. While we don't know exactly how many there are, we can use 365.25 days per year to get it as close as possible!

### Chapter 5:

#### full\_name\_greeting.rb

- Requirements
  - When run, it should:
    - Ask for your first, middle, and last name (one by one!)
    - Then greet you using the full name provided
- Advice
  - Main thing to keep in mind for this one is to make sure to use `gets.chomp` instead of just `gets`. That will make sure that you remove the newline character from each part of the name so you can string them together into the full name.

#### bigger\_better\_favorite\_number.rb

- Requirements
  - When run, it should:
    - Ask for your favorite number
    - Add 1 to it, and suggest this as a better favorite number (the more tactful the better)
- Advice
  - `gets.chomp` returns a string, so don't forget to use `.to_i` and `.to_s` as needed!

### Chapter 6:

#### angry\_boss.rb

- Requirements
  - Angry boss. Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
	  - `WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!`
- Clarifications/Advice
  - Make sure they shout everything, including your request.

#### table\_of\_contents.rb

- Requirements
  - Hereâ€™s something for you to do in order to play around more with center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will display a table of contents so that it looks like this:
  - While you're free to make side programs for your favorite books, the submission must be for Learn to Program, and go from chapter 1 to chapter 9 (the content we're covering in this course).
- Clarifications/Advice
  - Make sure to align it properly. A good tip is to make sure that each of the lines is the same length, which can be ensured by making sure that the arguments to `.center`, `.ljust`, and `.rjust` add up to the same total
  - You can see an example for what this should roughly look like below:

```
			     Table of Contents

Chapter 1: Getting Started				page  1
Chapter 2: Numbers				    	page  9
Chapter 3: Letters				    	page 13
```
