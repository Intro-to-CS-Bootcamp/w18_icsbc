# Intro to CS Bootcamp, Winter 2018

Before anything else, please take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/Intro-to-CS-Bootcamp/w18_icsbc/blob/master/helper_docs/videos.md">video guide</a> for how to install git (<a href="https://youtu.be/bvRPC-QpLnA">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQLhLG_rJcs">PC</a>), <a href="https://youtu.be/343TgCRIxbQ">set up your laptop</a> for the bootcamp, and an <a href="https://youtu.be/t3LI7S8nDZQ">overview of the course</a> so you can get started. There's more there that you should definitely check out, but those are the key ones.

One very important note is that those videos were recorded this last summer, so there's some differences in the material and URLs (course repo for this winter is https://github.com/Intro-to-CS-Bootcamp/w18_icsbc).

You may also find useful our <a href="https://github.com/Intro-to-CS-Bootcamp/ics_bc_s18/blob/master/helper_docs/git_overview.md"> overview of Git</a> helper doc, which also contains useful links if you want to learn git in full.
